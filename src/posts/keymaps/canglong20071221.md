title: Vertical Barring Sweep
writeup: |
  This layout is designed specifically for the Ferris Sweep with low-profile Choc switches and flat keycaps (MBK/CFX). It eliminates the need for reaching or dedicated number layers by using "Vertical Barring"—pressing the gap between two vertical keys to actuate them simultaneously.

  **Key Features:**
  * **Virtual Numbers:** Q+A=1, W+S=2, etc. (Actuated by pressing the gap).
  * **Mouse Layer:** Accessed by holding `E` (Left Middle Finger), allowing for stable mouse movement with the right hand (WASD-style on JKLI).
  * **Navigation:** Vim-style HJKL on a dedicated layer.
  * **Safety:** Home Row Mods are tuned with `require-prior-idle-ms` to prevent accidental triggers during fast typing.
